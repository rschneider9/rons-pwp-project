    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
    <p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</p>

<div>
    <h2>NavBar</h2>
    <p>A simple navbar with Alisha's business name on the left side, and the links in the middle. The links will be a way to easily get to different sections of the page. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Welcome image with business name</h2>
    <p>Background picture and business name on top-right side with a one line statement about what is Alisha's hair business. This statement will be a brief short and sweet message of the strengths Alisha has to offer. The background picture will not be over-baring or busy, so the statement/title will be easy to read and easy on the eyes.</p>

    <h2>Portfolio slide show</h2>
    <p>  A showcase of past clients Alisha has had, showing off her work. This would be 4-5 pictures, and the user would be able to slide it over to the next pictures. I would want to make it really clear that this is an interactive part of my web-page, so I will include slightly visible pictures to the left and right to show its interactive.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Me </h2>
    <p>
        A simple contact form to be fill out so the client will be able to get a hold of Alisha, ask questions, or book an appointments(over the phone). The paragraph to the right of the form  will include the price range of each service I listed on the Service section, also the convenience of her being able to come to YOU.
