    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
    <p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>NavBar</h2>
    <p>A simple navbar with Alisha's business name on the left side, and the links in the middle. The links will be a way to easily get to different sections of the page. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Welcome image with business name</h2>
    <p>Background picture and business name on top-right side with a one line statement about what is Alisha's hair business. This statement will be a brief short and sweet message of the strengths Alisha has to offer. The background picture will not be over-baring or busy, so the statement/title will be easy to read and easy on the eyes.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Bio on Alisha </h2>
    <p> This bio will be about Alisha's carree in Cosmetology with strong facts that stick out to the user. The background picture will be something not to bright or busy so that it will be easy to read the context of the bio.

<div>
    <h2>Portfolio slide show</h2>
    <p>  A showcase of past clients Alisha has had, showing off her work. This would be 4-5 pictures, and the user would be able to slide it over to the next pictures. I would want to make it really clear that this is an interactive part of my web-page, so I will include slightly visible pictures to the left and right to show its interactive.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Contact Me </h2>
    <p>
        A simple contact form to be fill out so the client will be able to get a hold of Alisha, ask questions, or book an appointments(over the phone). The paragraph to the right of the form  will include the price range of each service I listed on the Service section, also the convenience of her being able to come to YOU.
